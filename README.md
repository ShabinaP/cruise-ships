# Project Title
Cruise Ships

## Description
This project makes use of Object Oriented Programming by using classes/constructor functions to allow cruise-ships to dock at multiple ports that are within an itinerary, thowing an error when the end of the itinerary is reached.  A ship starts off anchored at a currentPort and takes an itinerary instance which is set to the first item in the itinerary. A Port goes into an itinerary's ports and this Itinerary gets passed to a Ship. The Port class has functionality to both add a ship (addShip) when it is docked at a Port instance, and remove a ship (removeShip) when it leaves the port. This is kept track of within the Ship Class functionality.
